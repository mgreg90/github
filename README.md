# github

github is a [playwright-cli](https://github.com/mgreg90/playwright-cli) script.
ADD DESCRIPTION HERE

## Installation

This script relies on the playwright-cli gem. Sharing features are still
in development for playwright, so for now, you'll need to run the following
commands to install it.

```shell
$ gem install playwright-cli
$ mkdir -p "$HOME/.playwright/plays"
$ cd "$HOME/.playwright/plays" && git clone git@github.com:[GIT_USERNAME]/github.git
$ ln -s "$HOME/.playwright/plays/github/github.rb" "/usr/local/bin/github"
```

In the future, expect a `$ playwright get github` command to exist.
